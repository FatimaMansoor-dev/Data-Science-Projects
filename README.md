# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects

Welcome to my repository containing various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) projects. 

### Bangalore House Price Prediction
- **Description**: This project predicts house prices in Bangalore using a machine learning model. It includes:
  - Frontend: HTML and CSS for the user interface.
  - Backend: Flask server for handling predictions.
- **Folder**: `bangalore_house_price_prediction`
- **Files**:
  - `server/server.py` : python flask server to execute model.
  - `model/banglore real state` : ipynb notebook for model code
  - `APP/app.html`: HTML file for the user interface.
  - `APP/style.css`: CSS file for the user interface.
  - `APP/script.js`: JS file for the user interface.
 

### Image Caption Generator
- **Description**: This project generates captions for images using deep learning techniques. It is designed to be run on Google Colab through the Kaggle API.
- **Folder**: `image_caption_generator`
- **Files**:
  - `yoo (1).ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the image caption generator.

### Next Word Predictor RNN
- **Description**: This project predicts the next word in a sequence using a recurrent neural network (RNN). It includes a Flask server (`app.py`) for running the predictor.
- **Folder**: `next_word_predictor_rnn`
- **Files**:
  - `lstm` : code for predictor model.
  - `model.h5` : saved LSTM model
  - `app.py`: Flask server for running the next word predictor.
  - `tokenizer.pkl`: Pickle file containing the tokenizer used for tokenizing input sequences.

### Cat Dog Classifier
- **Description**: This project classifies images as either cats or dogs using convolutional neural networks (CNN).
- **Folder**: `cat_dog_classifier`
- **Files**:
  - `CatVDog.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for training and evaluating the cat-dog classifier. 

### CIFAR-10 Classifier CNN
- **Description**: This project classifies images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 different classes using convolutional neural networks (CNN).
- **Folder**: `cifar10_classifier_cnn`
- **Files**:
  - `code.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for training and evaluating the CIFAR-10 classifier.
  - `model.pickle`: model for classifying CIFAR-10 images.
  - `app.py` : streamlit app for UI.
